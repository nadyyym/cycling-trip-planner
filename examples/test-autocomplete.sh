echo "======================================"

echo "Starting development server if not already running..."
echo "Please ensure 'npm run dev' is running in another terminal"
echo ""

echo "Testing autocomplete functionality implementation..."
echo ""

echo "Manual test steps:"
echo "1. Open http://localhost:3000/explore in your browser"
echo "2. Type in the search bar (sidebar) and verify:"
echo "   - Suggestions appear after 2+ characters"
echo "   - Loading spinner shows while fetching"
echo "   - Dropdown shows up to 5 relevant suggestions"
echo "   - Each suggestion shows city name and full address"
echo "   - MapPin icons appear next to each suggestion"
echo "3. Test keyboard navigation:"
echo "   - Arrow Down/Up to highlight suggestions"
echo "   - Enter to select highlighted suggestion"
echo "   - Escape to close dropdown"
echo "4. Test mouse interaction:"
echo "   - Click on any suggestion to select it"
echo "   - Verify map flies to selected location"
echo "   - Search input clears after selection"
echo "5. Test the location dialog (MapPin button):"
echo "   - Click MapPin button in top-right corner"
echo "   - Type in the dialog search input"
echo "   - Verify autocomplete works there too"
echo "   - Select a suggestion and verify dialog closes"
echo "6. Test search fallback:"
echo "   - Type a query and press Enter or click Search"
echo "   - Verify traditional search still works"
echo ""

echo "Expected behavior:"
echo "âœ… Suggestions appear within 300ms of typing"
echo "âœ… Debounced API calls (no excessive requests)"
echo "âœ… Caching prevents duplicate API calls"
echo "âœ… Keyboard navigation works smoothly"
echo "âœ… Map flies to selected location with smooth animation"
echo "âœ… Search input clears after selection"
echo "âœ… Loading indicators show during API calls"
echo "âœ… Dropdown closes on outside clicks"
echo "âœ… Both sidebar and dialog autocomplete work"
echo "âœ… Accessibility: screen reader friendly"
echo ""

echo "API call verification (check browser console):"
echo "- [MAPBOX_AUTOCOMPLETE_START] when typing begins"
echo "- [MAPBOX_AUTOCOMPLETE_SUCCESS] with result count"
echo "- No duplicate calls for same query (caching)"
echo "- Debouncing prevents rapid-fire requests"
echo ""

echo "Performance checks:"
echo "- Type rapidly and verify only final query is sent"
echo "- Same query should hit cache on subsequent use"
echo "- No memory leaks with repeated searches"
echo "- Dropdown renders smoothly with many results"
echo ""

echo "Accessibility verification:"
echo "- Tab navigation works for all interactive elements"
echo "- Screen reader announces combobox and options"
echo "- ARIA attributes are properly set"
echo "- Focus management works correctly"
echo ""

echo "Edge cases to test:"
echo "- Type gibberish and verify graceful handling"
echo "- Very long queries should not break layout"
echo "- Network errors should be handled gracefully"
echo "- Empty results should hide dropdown"
