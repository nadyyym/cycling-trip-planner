echo "Manual test steps:"
echo "1. Open http://localhost:3000/explore in your browser"
echo "2. Verify the bulky location section is REMOVED from the sidebar"
echo "3. Look for a minimal MapPin button (üìç) in the top-right corner of the map"
echo "4. Click the MapPin button to open the location dialog"
echo "5. Verify the dialog contains:"
echo "   - 'Use my current location' button"
echo "   - 'or' divider"
echo "   - Search input field"
echo "   - 'Search Location' button"
echo "6. Test both location methods work correctly"
echo "7. Check that search placeholder suggests using current location when not granted"

echo "Expected behavior:"
echo "‚úÖ Sidebar is more compact (saves 56+ pixels vertical space)"
echo "‚úÖ MapPin button is visible in top-right corner of map"
echo "‚úÖ Button has proper accessibility (aria-label, tooltip)"
echo "‚úÖ Dialog opens/closes correctly"
echo "‚úÖ Location functionality works same as before"
echo "‚úÖ Search placeholder is context-aware"
echo "‚úÖ All interactions are keyboard accessible"
echo ""

echo "Visual verification:"
echo "- Sidebar should look cleaner and take less vertical space"
echo "- MapPin button should have hover effects"
echo "- Dialog should be well-styled with proper spacing"
echo "- No console errors should appear"
echo ""

echo "Accessibility check:"
echo "- Tab navigation should work for all interactive elements"
echo "- Screen reader should announce 'Change location' for the button"
echo "- All form elements should have proper labels"

echo "Test completed! Check the browser for visual confirmation."
